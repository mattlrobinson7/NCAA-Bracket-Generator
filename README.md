NCAA-Bracket-Generator
======================

Makes a random bracket for NCAA Tournament. If you run this about 9.2 quintillion times, Warren Buffet's $1 Billion prize should be yours!

This program has two different implementations. The first is called "Seed Based" where the lower the seed, the likelier it is that
they will win. For example, when a 1 seed plays a 16 seed, the 1 seed has a 16/17 chance of moving on to the next round and if a 
4 seed plays a 5 seed, the 4 seed has a 5/9 chance of moving on.

The second implementation is called "Smart Trend Based". This implementation uses the trends from the past 25 years of the NCAA tournament
and based on the records of seed match ups, gives odds based on that. For example, when a 4 seed plays a 13 seed, in the last 25 years,
the 4 seed has 91 times and the 13 seed has only won 25 times. So the 4 seed would then have a 91/116 chance of winning that matchup.

For this year's tournament, I will be making 6 different brackets, 2 with the seed based implementation, 2 with the smart trend based
implementation, and 2 with my own basketball knowledge. After the tournament is over I will share my results and hopefully be $1 Billion
richer :)

RESULTS:
Day 1, around 5% of all brackets still were perfect after 5 games, Trend1 was one of them.
